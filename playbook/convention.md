# Convention — matching the upstream project's own norms

Decision rules for conforming a defect report to the specific upstream
project's stated process, so the report enters triage through the
channel and shape that project's maintainers already expect.

## Rules

1. **When** the upstream repository ships an issue template (`.github/
   ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` or a CONTRIBUTING.md-stated format) — **choice**:
   fill every templated field in that template's own order rather than
   free-writing a report and pasting it in; a report whose sections
   don't match the template's headings is harder for maintainers to
   triage against their own tooling (labels, bots keyed to headings).

2. **When** CONTRIBUTING.md or the issue template states a required
   pre-submission step (search existing issues, confirm against latest
   release, run a specific diagnostic command) — **choice**: perform
   that step and state its result in the report (e.g. "searched, no
   duplicate found"; "reproduces on latest tag vX.Y.Z"), not just the
   symptom; skipping a stated required step gets a report closed
   unread on many projects. source: Ten Simple Rules for Reporting a
   Bug, rules 2–3, PLOS Comput Biol (2022),

3. **When** the project's own commit/PR history shows a consistent
   commit-message convention (e.g. Conventional Commits, a scoped
   prefix style) for linked fix commits — **choice**: reference the
   defect using that project's own linking convention (issue number
   format, keyword like "Fixes #N") rather than an ad hoc cross-link,
   so the project's own automation (changelog generators, auto-close
   bots) picks it up. source: tenthirtyam, "Writing Practical
   Contribution Guidelines for GitHub Repositories,"

4. **When** the project designates a specific channel for the report
   type (e.g. security issues go to a private disclosure address, not
   the public tracker; usage questions go to a discussion forum, not
   the bug tracker) — **choice**: route to that channel instead of the
   general issue tracker even if the tracker is more visible; filing in
   the wrong channel is treated as a convention violation independent
   of report quality and gets redirected or ignored. source: Ten Simple
   Rules for Reporting a Bug, rule 4 (as above).

5. **When** a project's CONTRIBUTING.md is stale relative to its actual
   current workflow (a labeled path, a bot, or a template that no
   longer matches what maintainers actually ask for in recent closed
   issues) — **choice**: 생략 (drop) following the stale written
   instructions verbatim and instead pattern-match the last 5–10 merged/
   closed issues of the same type for the convention actually in
   force; treating a written-but-abandoned convention as authoritative
   produces a report that "obeys the rules" but still gets bounced.

   contribution docs, https://rivereditor.com/blogs/write-contribution-guide-open-source-project

6. **When** the reporter's own habitual tone (demanding, impatient, or
   entitled phrasing) would not match the collaborative tone the
   project's own contributor culture visibly uses in past accepted
   issues — **choice**: 줄이다 (reduce) hostile or demanding phrasing to
   a plain, patient statement of the problem; tone mismatch with the
   receiving community's convention measurably reduces the odds of a
   maintainer engaging at all. source: Ten Simple Rules for Reporting a
   Bug, rule 1 (as above).

7. **When** checking whether a defect has already been reported —
   **choice**: run a concrete similarity comparison (title/body overlap)
   against both the open backlog and the last 15-20 closed issues, not
   a single free-text keyword search; a defect closed as duplicate or
   wontfix under different wording than the reporter's own phrasing is
   invisible to a plain keyword search but not to an overlap comparison
   against the closed set. Treat closed issues as part of the dedup
   surface, not only open ones — a re-report of something already
   resolved wastes the same maintainer attention as a live duplicate.

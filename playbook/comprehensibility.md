# Comprehensibility — making the report readable by a stranger

Decision rules for structuring a defect report so a maintainer who has
zero context on the reporter's system can understand the failure on
first read, without back-and-forth.

## Rules

1. **When** describing the failure — **choice**: state expected
   behavior and actual behavior as two separate, labeled lines (not
   folded into one narrative sentence), so the gap between them is the
   first thing a reader parses, not something they must infer.

   Biol (2022),
   https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010540

2. **When** the report includes code, logs, commands, or file paths —
   **choice**: wrap each in a fenced/inline code block rather than plain
   prose; unformatted code mixed into prose measurably slows comprehension
   because the reader must re-parse token boundaries the formatting would
   otherwise mark for free. source: Ten Simple Rules for Reporting a Bug,
   rule 8 (as above); GitHub Flavored Markdown spec conventions,

3. **When** the environment (OS, runtime/interpreter version, package
   version, hardware) is not already pinned by a lockfile the maintainer
   can read — **choice**: state each relevant environment fact as its
   own labeled line (`OS:`, `version:`), not folded into prose, since a
   maintainer scanning many reports needs to pattern-match this field
   without re-reading a paragraph. source: Ten Simple Rules for
   Reporting a Bug, rule 7 (as above).

4. **When** the reproduction requires more than ~3 sequential steps —
   **choice**: number the steps as an ordered list, one action per line,
   rather than a paragraph describing the sequence; sequence information
   folded into prose imposes avoidable extraneous cognitive load on a
   reader who must reconstruct the step boundaries themselves. source:
   J. Sweller, "Cognitive Load Theory," Psychology of Learning and
   Motivation (2011) — extraneous load is created by presentation format,
   not just content, and is minimized by matching structure (sequence) to
   presentation (ordered list).

5. **When** a report would otherwise bury the single most decision-
   relevant fact (the exact error message, the line that throws, the
   version that regressed) inside a long log dump — **choice**: quote
   that one fact at the top of the report, above the fold, and keep the
   full dump as a collapsed/linked attachment below it. A reader's first
   screen of text should already contain the fact that lets them route
   or dedupe the report. source: Ten Simple Rules for Reporting a Bug,
   rule 8 (as above).

6. **When** the report would otherwise repeat the same failure
   description in the title, the body summary, and the reproduction
   section in three different phrasings — **choice**: 줄이다 (cut) it to
   one canonical phrasing used in the title and referenced, not
   restated, elsewhere; restating in varied wording adds re-parsing
   cost per Sweller redundancy effect without adding information.

   effect.
